### Tablet usage and experience in care homes - text mining for select survey responses

NHSX is helping care homes to stay connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 10,000 free tablet devices were offered to care homes for communication with health professionals, family and friends.
With care homes having recently received their iPad(s) (December), NHSX followed up with a survey in January to know what care homes thought about the iPad to date in terms of usage and experience - to help NHSX understand which aspects care homes have found useful and where things could be improved.

Some questions involved open-ended (free-text) replies, or a sub-option such as 'Other' where free text was enabled.
These R scripts were used to aid with identifying patterns and key messages among the 1000+ responses, where the survey platform itself offered limited capability.
Input and output folders not provided due to disclosiveness.

#### Questions analysed:
- What type of care is provided, if 'Other' selected (Q2)
- What have the iPads been used for, if 'Other' selected (Q5)
- If there was anything they would like to do with the iPad that they can’t at the moment, what would that be (Q12)
- As conclusion to the survey, any further feedback regarding the iPad (Q17)

#### Text analysis:
- Word frequency (barplots, wordclouds)
- n-gram frequency and directional charts
